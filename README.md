<h1>Application for EPC </h1>



    ♦   I have created an EPC company website to book an appointment, login, signup, about and notifications page.

    ♦   An admin can only see all the User list and notifications, which contains appointments on today. 

    ♦   An admin can change the status of user also. He can change complete / Open status on each user.

    ♦   User can see only about and book an appointment section. It contains a calender to book an appointment.

    ♦   A customer needs to sign up or login to book an appointment. He can sign out also.

    ♦   All the API section is controlled by springboot and MySQL server.
